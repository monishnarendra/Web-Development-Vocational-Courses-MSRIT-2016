	<br><br>

	<p>
	When I was a kid, I was a Boy Scout. I made it pretty far too, but then I became a teenager, decided it was 
	“lame,” and quit. As a Boy Scout, I learned how to tie knots, camp outdoors, be a good citizen, play with knives, 
	and got to have cool sleepovers. One of the most important things you learn as a Boy Scout is their motto to always 
	“be prepared,” and as I’ve grown up and traveled the world, I’ve found this to also be a travel truism.
	</p>

	<br>	

	<p>
	You never know what might happen on the road. Stepping out your door into the unknown is what makes travel 
	so exciting. Each day brings endless possibility, but that possibility is for both good and bad. You may 
	end up enjoying a day sightseeing in Paris — or getting robbed in Berlin. You may spend an amazing day on 
	the beaches of Thailand — or suffer food poisoning in Costa Rica.
	</p>

	<br>

	<p>
	But if you’re prepared, you’ll be able to face whatever happens to you on the road:
	</p>
<br>
	<p>
	1] <b>Take Multipurpose Gear.</b> Packing multiuse gear ensures you can easily adjust to changing conditions and 
	helps reduce the amount of clothing you need to take. I like pants that zip off into shorts, walking 
	shoes that look nice enough for an evening out, and using my swim trunks as a pair of shorts. It saves 
	room, and I’m prepared for any dress situation.
	</p>

	<p>
	2] <b>Carry a Small First Aid Kit.</b> While we live in 2012, not 1912, and you can find modern medicine 
	anywhere in the world, I always carry a small first aid kit with me with a few essential items to be 
	safe. I take Tylenol, stomach illness medicine, eyedrops, Band-Aids, scissors, hydrocortisone cream, 
	antibacterial ointment, and a small supply of doctor-approved antibiotics. I’m usually able to find a 
	pharmacy when I need one, but in case of an emergency, it’s good to have these items handy.
	</p>

	<p>
	3] <b>Pack a Small Flashlight.</b>You’d be surprised how many travelers don’t carry one, but a flashlight 
	will prove to be invaluable when you suddenly decide to go caving in Panama, when your hike lasts longer 
	than expected and nightfall sets in, or when the electricity goes out unexpectedly, which is not uncommon 
	in a lot of places. I carry a small, waterproof pen flashlight when I travel.
	</p>

	<p>
	4] <b>Bring an Umbrella. </b>Many travelers don’t pack an umbrella because it adds weight to their bag, and 
	they figure they can just buy one if they ever need it. However, while it does add a small amount of weight, 
	I’ve found myself thankful for taking it more times than I can count. You never know when you might be exiting 
	an airport or walking down the street and find yourself in a sudden storm. While others run for cover, I simply 
	take out my umbrella and continue to my destination.
	</p>

	<p>
	5] <b>Learn Basic Phrases.</b> Locals don’t expect you to be an expert in their language, but knowing how to say 
	“hello,” “goodbye,” and “thank you” go a long way in endearing yourself to locals. After all, wouldn’t you be 
	annoyed if someone came to your home and expected you to know their language? Knowing a few key phrases will 
	not only make interactions easier, it will also help you when you bargain for goods, order food, get lost, or 
	need help. I download the latest language app for my iPhone when I travel, but for those not using a smartphone, 
	Lonely Planet guidebooks makes excellent pocket language guides for just about every language spoken, and Benny 
	Lewis wrote this excellent guide on learning languages.
	</p>

	<p>
	6] <b>Study Nonverbal Communication.</b>Most people interact using both verbal and nonverbal communication, so 
	paying attention to facial expressions can help you appropriately read a situation, even if you don’t understand 
	the verbal part. When you don’t know the language or might take words out of context, keep calm and take a moment 
	to read the feelings of the person. This has helped me defuse tense situations with taxi drivers, vendors, and 
	hotel owners. Understanding nonverbal communication doesn’t happen overnight. It takes practice, but these websites 
	offer good guides on how to understand nonverbal cues.
	</p>

	<p>
	7] <b>Keep Emergency Cash with You.</b>While there is almost always an ATM around these days, you never know when 
	emergency cash might come in handy. You could end up in an airport (like I recently did) and find that none of 
	your ATM cards work and you are stuck without any money. I recommend having a stash of $200 USD for emergency 
	situations. I don’t carry this money around but leave it in my hotel room safe in case something happens. It 
	will be useful if you get robbed or lose your wallet.
	</p>

	<p>
	8] <b>Have Backup Cards.</b>I always keep one backup credit card and bank card with me in case of emergencies. 
	You never know when one bank might decide to lock your account for suspicious activity without telling you (yes, 
	that has also happened to me) or when you might get robbed. I recently had my bank account information stolen while 
	I was traveling in Europe. My bank had to deactivate my card, and if I hadn’t had a second one with me, I wouldn’t 
	have had access to any money.
	</p>

	<p>
	9] <b>Carry Cash.</b>With the advent of the chip credit card, many countries don’t take the American-style credit 
	card anymore (cards with just a magnetic strip). While you should be able to use a credit card pretty much everywhere, 
	you never know when you might not. One of my cards was rejected in Denmark because it lacked a chip, and I had to run 
	to a bank to get money. We get used to using credit cards, but it’s always good to have a little cash.
	</p>

	<p>
	10] <b>Make Extra Copies.</b>Keeping copies of your documents can come in handy during an emergency, especially if you 
	lose your originals. If you get robbed or lose your passport, having copies ready for officials can make filing 
	police reports and obtaining new documents much easier. When I lost my passport, my backup copies helped with my 
	police report and served as my proof of identity at the American embassy. Copy your passport, your health/travel insurance paperwork, and your credit cards.
